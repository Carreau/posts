This might include nbviewer, it we consider that css are safe enough and got the time to add the concept of `user` to nbviewer I don't see any reason not to support external css. @damiamavilla already have build a slideshow version of nbviewer (that we will probably release in the next 6 month) that support multiple theme for the same notebook. And if you made some theme, feel free to share, I even think that a [user-governed](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/IPython-contrib) repository with multiple css woudl be great."
