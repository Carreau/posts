Two weeks ago I was pleased to announce the release of the [Open-with-Binder for
Firefox extension](./31-open-in-binder-browser-extension.html).

After [asking on twitter if people were interested in the same for
Chrome](https://twitter.com/Mbussonn/status/933746729828134912) (29 Yes, 67 No,
3 Other) and pondering whether or not to pay the Chrome Developer Fee for the
Chrome App store, I decided to take my chance and try to publish it last week. 

I almost just had to use Mozilla WebExt Shim for Chrome, downgrade a few artwork
from SVG to PNG (like really??) and upload all by hand, like really again ?

The Chrome Store  **has way more fields** and it is quite **complicated** –
compared to the Mozilla Addons website at least – It is sometime confusing
**whether fields are optional or not**, or if they are **per addons on per
developer ?** 

It does though allow you to upload **more art** that will be show in a store
which that **looks nicer**.

Still I had to pay to go through a **really ugly crappy website and had to pay
for it** to publish a free extension. So Mozilla you win this.

Please rate the extension, or it may not appear in search results for others AFAICT:

install Open with Binder for chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/open-with-binder/napgohblobncpnagnehjpooinnimhpkc)

It works identically to the Firefox one, you get a button on the toolbar and
click on it when visiting GitHub.

Enjoy.
